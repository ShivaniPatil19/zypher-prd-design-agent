Product: Smart Receipt Uploader for Personal Budgeting

Context:
Our mobile app helps individuals track their monthly spending. Right now, users have to manually type in each expense, which is slow and error-prone.

High-Level Idea:
Allow users to upload photos or PDFs of receipts, automatically extract key fields (total amount, date, merchant, category), and sync them to their budgeting dashboard.

Core Needs:
- User can upload a receipt from mobile.
- We automatically read the total, tax, date, and merchant.
- User can review and edit extracted data before saving.
- Expenses should appear in the existing "Monthly Budget" view.
- User can delete or correct a receipt later.
- Users want a simple way to export monthly expenses to CSV.

Constraints / Notes:
- MVP can be English-only.
- We don't need to support handwritten receipts in v1.
- Must not break existing budgeting features.
- We should handle failed OCR gracefully (e.g., "we couldn't read this, please type it in").
